This is the webpage for the Honours/MSc course Simulating Language, running in academic year 2020/2021. We will add links to materials (readings, videos, code) to this page; you will need to use Learn for electronic submission of your assessed work, and to keep an eye out for any course announcements.


## Course summary

To be written, but to cover: Language learning and language evolution. Models. A practical course. No programming knowledge assumed, but you will be doing stuff with code.

## The teaching team

[Simon Kirby](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/), [Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/) and [Matt Spike](https://sites.google.com/site/matspike/) are the main lecturers and lab demonstrators - the best way to get in touch with us is in one of the drop-in lab sessions, see below, or by email/Teams (TBC). In the drop-in labs we'll be assisted by Claire Graf, [Annie Holz](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/annie-holtz) and Henry Conklin.

## Structure of the course

Each week there are two main kinds of content: readings and lecture recordings, and then a programming practical.

You should be able to work through the readings and lecture recordings in your own time - the readings consist of our notes plus a mix of journal papers and book chapters, and the recordings summarise the main points we want you to take from those materials. For some weeks also have associated quizzes or mini-tests so you can evaluate your own understanding.

You can also attempt the programming practical on your own, but we will be providing drop-in labs at set times each week (platform TBC) where you can come and get our help to figure out problems. You are also welcome to just turn up in drop-in labs to work through things on your own with us in the background - some people find that having set times helps them focus.

You should complete the reading materials and lecture videos for a given week before attempting the programming practical or attending the drop-in lab classes - the practicals involve playing with models that implement the ideas covered in the readings and lecture recordings, so will make a lot more sense when you have that context.

Each week there is a designated academic lead, who sets the readings and appears in the lecture recording materials - if you have content questions on a given week, the academic lead for that week should be one of your points of contact, but we are all familiar with all of the content so anyone you see at drop-in labs should be able to help!

## Timetable for drop-in labs

We'll be available online (platform TBC) to help you at the following times in weeks 2-11:
- Thursdays, 9am-11am
- Thursdays, 1pm-3pm
- Fridays, 9am-11am

You can drop in at any time during these hours and ask questions, get help with the programming practicals, or just hang out with other people who are working on the course. You can come as much or as little as you want: we'll be sad if we never see you, but you'll probably be sad if you see us too much.

## Assessment

TBC.
